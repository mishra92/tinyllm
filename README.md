Pre-requirement: API Key

Before using this model, please make sure to set your API key.

This model is designed to be lightweight and memory-less, focused on solving basic mathematical questions efficiently.

Important:
The model requires an API key to function. Ensure that you have the key set up before running `main.py`.

How to Use:

1. Obtain your API key from the appropriate provider.
2. Set it as an environment variable or directly in the script (as per your setup).

```bash
export API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or inside your Python script:

```python
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```
